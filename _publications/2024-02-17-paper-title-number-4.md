excerpt: 'Excerpt: Given that Texas and Australia are on opposite ends of these phenomena, an inverse relationship between the climate disaster impacts of El Niño and La Niña on these two regions is expected. Therefore, identifying trends between Texan and Australian climate disasters is crucial to making predictions for the impacts of the incoming La Niña. '
