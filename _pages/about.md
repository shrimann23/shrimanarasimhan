Hello! Welcome to my web page. 

I'm Shrimayee, a second-year undergraduate student majoring in computer science at UW Seattle. I am fascinated by computer science's applications to the environment and global health. In particular, I am interested in utilizing machine learning and geographic information systems (GIS) to tackle international challenges. Beyond my technical experience, I am skilled in outreach, leading large groups, and collaborating with those of diverse backgrounds.

Apart from school, I enjoy playing the violin, snacking, and hiking with friends and family!
