title: "SignScribe: DubHacks 2023 Project"
excerpt: "For DubHacks 2023, my team and I decided to create an acessibility tool to aid those who use American Sign Language. We developed SignScribe, a web-based tool that allows users to have their signs transcribed in real-time. SignScribe was developed using machine learning image classification, Python, Flask, HTML and CSS. DubHacks 2023 was my first in-person hackathon; it was a pleasure working on SignScribe with my amazing teammates (Trisha, Jules, and Arya)! <br/><img src='/images/signscribe.png'>"

SignScribe is a web-based tool that allows users to have their signs transcribed in real-time. It uses image classification to capture hand poses and convert them to the appropriate expression. SignScribe is a web-based tool that allows users to have their signs transcribed in real-time. It uses image classification to capture hand poses and convert them to the appropriate expression.

To build SignScribe, we first trained a machine-learning model using a data set sourced from Kaggle. We then used Python to build the backend, which detects signs from user input every five frames and picks the most likely sign from the model's predictions. For the front end, we designed the layout in Figma and coded it using HTML and CSS. Lastly, we linked the front and back end together using Flask to complete our comprehensive application.
