title: "RevereXR Hackathon: OrchidXR"
excerpt: "I forayed into the intersection of extended reality and web development during the RevereXR Hackathon. My team and I developed OrchidXR, a 3D Augmented Reality web application telling the story of Mrs. Toliver, an elder from Seattle's historically-black Central District. Our web application allows our users to 'travel' in a bus through Seattle's Central District, experiencing each of the places and memories central to Mrs. Toliver's story. See our demo video here: https://lnkd.in/gMgirE3s.  I'm proud of my team (Arya Sanjay, Eileen Dong, Chantal Zhou, and myself) for creating an AR experience using 8th Wall AR, Unity, and Blender in conjunction for the first time! <br/><img src='/images/orchidxr.png'>"
