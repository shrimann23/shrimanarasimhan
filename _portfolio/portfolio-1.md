title: "MARA - Mobile App for Contraceptive Education in Kenya"
excerpt: "I worked in a team to develop MARA, a fully functioning mobile application providing contraceptive education and decision support for young Kenyan women in pharmacy settings. My teammates and I worked under Professor Richard Anderson and PhD student Lisa Orii as part of the UW ICTD Lab. I specifically contributed to the creation of a dynamic video playback interface optimized for the app's multilingual interface. Our app is designed for Android tablets and was developed using the Flutter SDK, Dart programming language, and Android Studio. <br/><img src='/images/mara.png'>"
